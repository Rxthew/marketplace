# The Marketplace App


## Description

This app simulates the front-end side of a small-scale e-commerce platform.

## Remarks 

This app has been worthwhile on several fronts, it has increased my familiarity with React, TypeScript and 
TailWindCSS giving me the experience of greater agility in implementing my plans. This was supplemented by 
gaining greater depth to my understanding, especially in regard to the lifecycle of functional components, 
particularly in relation to reconciliation. I also managed to build on these foundations by getting up to 
speed with React testing, using Jest and by getting my feet wet with React-RouterDom.



These were the benchmarks I was aiming for prior to the start of this project, however I gained a broader 
induction when I took a more studied approach  to testing via the browser. I felt that the app was lagging 
so I introduced lazy-loading via the Intersection Observer API. Content-shifting became a particular challenge
in this regard, for example a number of articles I read advocated for the [padding-bottom hack](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/ways-to-reduce-content-shifting-on-page-load/)
which I found convoluted and repulsive, so I eschewed that in favour of a simpler approach. I also realised it was 
not up to a minimum standard in terms of accessiblity so I made sure to use semantic HTML where possible, and added 
aria-labels where appropriate.
